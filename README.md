# Portfolio

I tried to build a multi-pag portfolio. 
## Sections:
            3 Sections.

        3-MY PORTFOLIO.
        
All these sections are inter-linked and can be navigated from one another. The navigation at the top as well as at bottom can be used for same purpose. Most of the classes are used from bootsrap, although I did linked my external css files to achieve certain desired changes. The projects I worked on and the applications I developed are included in portfolio section.
                
     
     
     
   ## Responsiveness
   
   The project is made responsive for different types of user views and adjusts its parameters accordingly.  

   ## Deployable Projects
   - Jquery Calculator
   - Weather Dashboard
   - Work Day Schduler
   - Node Readme File Generator
   - A running application ( Let's Run )
